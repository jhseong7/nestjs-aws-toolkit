# NestJS AWS Toolkit

This is a collection of NestJS modules to interact with some AWS services.

Currently it supports:

- SQS

But I am planning to add more services in the future.

The toolkit aims to provide a simple way to initialize and inject AWS service resources throughout the NestJS application, without the need of managing each and every instance on your own.
